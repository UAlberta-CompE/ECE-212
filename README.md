# ECE 212 – Introduction to Microprocessors Labs

This repository contains all lab materials for ECE 212, including lab manuals, assembly source code, verification artifacts, and submitted lab reports. It serves as a complete record of hands-on work involving low-level programming, hardware interaction, and microprocessor system behavior.

## Repository Structure

### Lab 1
- ECE 212 Lab Report 1
- Assembly programs (Lab1a, Lab1b)

### Lab 2
- Assembly programs (Lab2a, Lab2b)
- Result screenshots and verification images

### Lab 3
- Lab manual
- ECE 212 Lab Report 3
- Assembly programs (Lab3a, Lab3b, Lab3c)
- Marking and result artifacts

### Lab 4
- Lab manual
- Hardware verification documentation
- Supporting files and program assets

## Course Focus

The labs emphasize:
- Assembly-level programming for microprocessors
- Register-level control and memory-mapped I/O
- Interrupts, timing, and hardware verification
- Debugging and validation using real hardware
- Clear technical documentation and reporting

## Tools and Technologies

- Assembly language programming
- Microcontroller development boards
- Hardware verification workflows
- Manual testing and result validation

## Purpose

This repository is intended for academic archival and portfolio documentation. All contents reflect coursework submitted for ECE 212 and are not intended for reuse for academic credit.

## Status

Completed.
